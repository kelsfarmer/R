R programming and scripts

This repository houses different examples of my work using the R statistical software.  All examples were performed using public data or data that was simulated to demonstrate work that was also performed using client data.  However no actual client data, directory names, database names, data field names, or other meta data is included in these examples; all work has been cleansed for use as an example to be shared.
